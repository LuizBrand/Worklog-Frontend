# Atomic Progress Log

Your temporal anchor. Tick atomic tasks as you complete them. Never mark a
task done unless `memory/verify.md` criteria are met.

The `state-enforcement.sh` hook blocks task completion if source files
changed but this file wasn't updated.

## In Progress

<!-- nothing in flight -->

## Completed (this session)

- [x] 2026-04-26 — Scaffolded agent-md framework (memory/, .claude/
  hooks, .githooks/pre-commit, agent-md.toml) — committed as `fb6f774`.
- [x] 2026-04-26 — Slice 1: Orval codegen wired end-to-end. Snapshot at
  `openapi/worklog.json`, react-query hooks under
  `src/api/generated/<tag>/`, zod schemas under
  `src/api/generated/zod/<tag>/`, mutator `src/api/mutator.ts` reusing
  `src/lib/api.ts`. Springdoc emits an invalid `name` field on
  `securitySchemes.bearerAuth` (http scheme); `scripts/sanitize-openapi.mjs`
  strips it and is chained into `pnpm api:fetch`. Removed orval v8-invalid
  `prettier: true` from both outputs in `orval.config.ts`. Verified:
  `pnpm api:gen` ✓, `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` ✓, `pnpm lint` ✓, all 5
  tags present (autenticação, sistemas, usuários, tickets, clientes).

## TDD-check exemptions (this slice)

- `src/api/mutator.ts` — thin axios wrapper providing `customInstance`
  for orval-generated clients. No business behavior; project has no
  test runner configured yet (`memory/agents.md` notes the missing
  `test` script). Behavior will be exercised indirectly by every
  generated endpoint hook and validated by typecheck + manual API
  smoke when slices land.

## Backlog (next up)

- [ ] Wire react-query `QueryClient` defaults (staleTime, retries,
  error mapping from `ApiExceptionResponse`).
- [ ] Auth slice: login screen → store JWT → refresh token rotation.
- [ ] `src/lib/api.ts` reads `localStorage` in the request interceptor
  unconditionally — breaks under Next.js SSR. Guard with
  `typeof window !== 'undefined'` (or move token to a client-only
  store) before the auth slice ships.
- [ ] Configure `core.hooksPath = .githooks` so the pre-commit
  verification stack runs locally (currently inactive).
